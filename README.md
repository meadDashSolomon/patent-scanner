# Patent Scanner

## About the Project

`Patent Scanner` is a tool developed to streamline the process of retrieving, analyzing, and formatting the locations of patent assignees and inventors. This tool operates at a rate approximately 500 times faster than manual processing and with greater accuracy, eliminating a common source of human error. The information retrieved is critical for testing the hypothesis that patent holders located outside the United States are less likely to defend their patents when challenged as invalid.

## Features

- Retrieves the locations of patent assignees and inventors from patent documents.
- Prioritizes US locations based on postal abbreviations.
- Formats and outputs data ready for spreadsheet import.

## Usage

To use this script, ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed. Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
